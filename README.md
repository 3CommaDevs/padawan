## **PROJECT PADAWAN**

This is Project Padawan, a personality test tool that puts an emphasis on accuracy. The goal for Project Padawan
is to gain knowledge about team members' personality traits to maximize production. By knowing strengths and 
weaknesses we can not only build up our consultants but we can put them in situations where they will succeed.
