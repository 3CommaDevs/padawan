## **PROJECT PADAWAN**

	This is Project Padawan, a personality test tool that puts an emphasis on accuracy. The goal for Project Padawan
	is to gain knowledge about team members' personality traits to maximize production. By knowing strengths and 
        weaknesses we can not only build up our consultants but we can put them in situations where they will succeed.
